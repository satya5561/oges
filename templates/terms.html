            limited to, Facebook; each such account, a “Third-Party Account”) by either: providing Your Third Party Account login information through the Coride

            Third Party Account. You represent that You are entitled to disclose Your Third Party Account login information to Coride and/or grant Coride access to

            <strong>Bookings and Financial Terms for Drivers</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            If you are a Driver and a booking is requested for your Ride via the Coride Platform, you will be required to either confirm or reject the booking within
            24 hours of when the booking is requested (as determined by Coride in its sole discretion) or the booking request will be automatically cancelled. When a
            booking is requested via the Coride Platform, Application and Services, we will share with you (i) the first name of the
            Passenger who has requested the booking, (ii) a link to the Passenger’s Coride Account profile page, (iii) the names of any members of an SNS with whom you
            are “friends” or associated on the SNS if such individuals are also “friends” or associated with the Passenger on such SNS, and (iv) an indication that the
            name that the Passenger provided to Coride when the Passenger became a Member matches the name that the Passenger provided to the SNSs to which the
            Passenger has linked his or her Coride Account, so that you can view such information before confirming or rejecting the booking. If you are unable to
            confirm or decide to reject a booking of a Ride within such 24 hour period, the booking will be automatically cancelled. Any amounts collected by Coride
            will be refunded to such Passenger, depending on the selections the Passenger makes via the Coride Platform, and any pre-authorization of such Passenger’s
            credit card will be released, if applicable. When you confirm a booking requested by a Passenger, Coride will send you and the Passenger an email, text
            message or message via the Coride Platform confirming said booking.
        </p>
        <p>
            The fees displayed in each Ride are comprised of the Booking Fees (defined below), Driver Fees (defined below) and the Passenger Fees (defined below.) The
            Driver Fees and Passenger Fees together make up the Service Fees that are paid to Coride. Where applicable, Taxes may be charged in addition to these fees.
            The Booking Fees, Driver Fees, the Passenger Fees and applicable Taxes are collectively referred to in these Terms as the “Total Fees”. The amounts due and
            payable by a Passenger solely relating to a Driver’s Ride are the “Booking Fees”. Please note that it is the Driver and not Coride who determines the
            Booking Fee.
        </p>
        <p>
            Coride charges a fee to the Driver based on a fraction of the applicable Booking Fees which are the “Driver Fees”. Coride charges a fee to Passengers based
            upon a percentage of applicable Booking Fees which are the “Passenger Fees”. The Passenger Fees are added to the Booking Fees to calculate the Total Fees
            (which will also include the Driver Fees and applicable Taxes) displayed in the applicable Ride listing. Coride will collect the Total Fees at the time of
            booking confirmation (i.e. when the Driver confirms the booking within 24 hours of the booking request) and will initiate payment of the Booking Fees (less
            Coride’s Driver Fees (defined below)) to the Driver within 72 hours after the leaving at time of the applicable Ride (except to the extent that a refund is
            due to the Passenger).
        </p>
        <p>
            Appointment of Coride as Payment Agent for Driver. Each Driver hereby appoints Coride as the Driver’s limited agent solely for the purpose of collecting
            payments made by Passengers on behalf of the Driver. Each Driver agrees that payment made by a Passenger to Coride shall be considered the same as a
            payment made directly to the Driver and the Driver will make the Ride available to Passenger in the agreed upon manner as if the Driver has received the
            Ride Fees. Cancellations and refunds will be governed by the Cancellation Policy below. In accepting appointment as the limited authorized agent of the
            Driver, Coride assumes no liability for any acts or omissions of the Driver.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Bookings and Financial Terms for Passengers </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            <br/>
            The Drivers, not Coride, are solely responsible for honoring any confirmed bookings and making available any Rides reserved through the Coride Platform. If
            you, as a Passenger, choose to enter into a transaction with a Driver for the booking of an Ride, you agree and understand that you will be required to
            enter into an agreement with the Driver and you agree to accept any terms, conditions, rules and restrictions associated with such Ride imposed by the
            Driver. You acknowledge and agree that you, and not Coride, will be responsible for performing the obligations of any such agreements, that Coride is not a
            party to such agreements, and that, with the exception of its payment obligations hereunder, Coride disclaims all liability arising from or related to any
            such agreements. You acknowledge and agree that, notwithstanding the fact that Coride is not a party to the agreement between you and the Driver, Coride
            acts as the Driver’s payment agent for the limited purpose of accepting payments from you on behalf of the Driver. Upon your payment of amounts to Coride
            which are due to the Driver, your payment obligation to the Driver for such amounts is extinguished, and Coride is responsible for remitting such amounts,
            less Coride’s Driver and Passenger Fees, to the Driver. In the event that Coride does not remit any such amounts to a Driver, such Driver will have
            recourse only against Coride.
        </p>
        <p>
            When you book a Ride, you will be asked to pre-authorize payment for the Total Fees. As noted above, the Driver is required to either confirm or reject the
            booking within 24 hours of when the booking is requested (as determined by Coride in its sole discretion) or the requested booking will be automatically
            cancelled. If a requested booking is cancelled (i.e. not confirmed by the applicable Driver), any amounts collected by Coride will be refunded to such
            Passenger, depending on the selections the Passenger makes via the Coride Platform, and any pre-authorization of such Passenger’s credit card will be
            released, if applicable.
        </p>
        <p>
            You agree to pay Coride for the Total Fees for any booking requested in connection with your Coride Account if such requested bookings are confirmed by the
            applicable Driver. In order to establish a booking pending the applicable Driver’s confirmation of your requested booking, you understand and agree that
            Coride, on behalf of the Driver, reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to (i) obtain a pre-authorization via your credit card for the Total Fees or
            (ii) charge your credit card a nominal amount, not to exceed one dollar ($1), or a similar sum in the currency in which you are transacting ( e.g. one euro
            or one British pound) to verify your credit card. Once Coride receives confirmation of your booking from the applicable Driver, Coride will collect the
            Total Fees in accordance with the terms and conditions of these Terms and the pricing terms set forth in the applicable Listing. Please note that Coride
            cannot control any fees that may be charged to a Passenger by his or her bank related to Coride’s collection of the Total Fees, and Coride disclaims all
            liability in this regard.
        </p>
        <p>
            In connection with your requested booking, you will be asked to provide customary billing information such as name, billing address and credit card
            information either to Coride or its third party payment processor. You agree to pay Coride for any confirmed bookings made in connection with your Coride
            Account in accordance with these Terms by one of the methods described on the Coride Platform – e.g. by credit card. You hereby authorize the collection of
            such amounts by charging the credit card provided as part of requesting the booking, either directly by Coride or indirectly, via a third party online
            payment processor or by one of the payment methods described on the Coride Platform. If you are directed to Coride’s third party payment processor, you may
            be subject to terms and conditions governing use of that third party’s service and that third party’s personal information collection practices. Please
            review such terms and conditions and privacy policy before using the services. Once your confirmed booking transaction is complete you will receive a
            confirmation email summarizing your confirmed booking.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Fees</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Booking Fees. The Booking Fee is the amount due and payable by a Passenger in exchange for booking the User Provided Services of a Driver. The Booking Fee can be $0. The maximum Booking Fee is $0.56 per mile. Between these bounds, the Driver
            alone, and not Coride, determines the Booking Fee. The Driver may in his or her sole discretion decide to include in these amounts
            (i) the cost of fuel, (ii) taxes that the Driver determines that he or she has to collect. Passengers agree that any mandatory amounts charged following a
            ride (a "Charge") are due immediately.<strong></strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Passenger Fees. A Passenger Fee is the fee that Coride charges a Passenger for the use of its online platform, which is calculated as a percentage of the
            applicable Booking Fees. The Passenger Fees will be displayed to the Passenger when the Passenger is asked whether to send a booking request to a Driver.
        </p>
        <p>
            Driver Fees. A Driver Fee is the fee that Coride charges a Driver for the use of its online platform, which is calculated as a percentage of the applicable
            Booking Fee. The Driver Fees will be displayed to the Driver when the Driver is asked whether to confirm or reject a booking request from a prospective
            Passenger.
        </p>
        <p>
            Service Fees. Service Fees are the Passenger Fees and the Driver Fees together collected by Coride.
        </p>
        <p>
            Total Fees. Total Fees refers to collectively the Driver Fees and the Passenger Fees (plus any Taxes in respect of Passenger Fees, such as VAT in Europe).
        </p>
        <p>
            Facilitation of Payments. All fees and payments, as applicable, shall be facilitated through Stripe, Inc., Coride 's third-party payment processing
            service. You understand and agree that if the transfer fails (for example, due to a typo in the bank details), it can take up to five business days for
            Stripe to be notified. Coride reserves the right to put any rejected payment or transfer into investigation and freeze the amount rejected up to 30 days.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Cancellations and Refunds</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Driver Cancellation. In the event that a Driver cancels a trip or individual booking, Passengers receive a refund of all fees. In the event of a Driver
            cancelling a trip with any confirmed bookings, Coride reserves the right to apply penalties or consequences to your profile at our sole discretion,
            including but not limited to (i) posting an automated negative review, (ii) charging you a cancellation fee to be withdrawn from your future payouts, (iii)
            temporarily or permanently suspending your access to the Coride Platform.
        </p>
        <p>
            Passenger Cancellation. Passengers do not have the option to cancel a booking. Currently all bookings are final unless cancelled by the driver. A Passenger
            may request to a driver to cancel their booking (which will refund all fees to the Passenger), but whether a cancellation and refund is provided is done at
            the discretion of the driver.
        </p>
        <p>
